= Installation =

Installation is simple. The program is distributed in a zip file, and the contents of that zip are all you need to run it. Just extract the contents wherever you like, then run the "Sprite Recolorer.exe".

= Getting Started =

When you run the program, it's all blank. To get started, open the File menu and select "Open Templates". The popup will prompt you to select two files. These are the image files that you are recoloring. The first image will be the subject (i.e. shape) and the second image will be the new colors. Once you select two valid image files, the Template Editor will open.

= The Editor =

The Template Editor shows you the two input images, a sampling of the colors in those images, a mapping from Image 1's colors to Image 2's colors, and a preview. The zoom level on the preview can be changed by dragging the slider bar (it goes by multiples of 2, from 1/8x to 8x). To change the color mapping, just click one of the color buttons and select a new color from the popup.

= Some Nice Features =

You can undo and redo changes to your color mappings as you go. Each Template Editor has its own history, so pressing "Undo" in one editor will not affect the state of another editor. You can also save the current state of the recolored image by selecting "Save" or "Save As" from the File menu.
